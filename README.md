# Plantidex

An image repository for plants.
You can find it hosted at.
Or if you have the time and interest, you can set it up locally, which involves:
 - Running a script to scrape Google images for plant images
 
 - async

## Start the server
```
# Start the server
docker-compose up

# Start the server in the background
docker-compose up -d

# See only app logs
docker-compose logs -f app
```

## API reference
API reference can be found at [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## Motivation
I love plants. A while ago I started doing the [fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders course](https://course.fast.ai/), and it's been at the top of my mind to try my hand at building a plant identification app ever since.
